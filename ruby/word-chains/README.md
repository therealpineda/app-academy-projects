# Word Chains

```sh
-app-academy-project
-ruby 2.3.0
```

Builds a path of chained words, changing one letter at a time, from source to target. Enter source and target as argument variables in the command line when running this file. Words must both be of the same length!

It will output either the path or "No path found" if none is found.

For example:
```sh
ruby ./word_chains.rb market legion
```

Returns:
```sh
The path is: market --> marker --> barker --> banker --> banter --> ranter --> renter --> render --> lender --> leader --> leaser --> lesser --> lessen --> lesson --> lesion --> legion
```
