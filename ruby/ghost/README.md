Ruby implementation of word game, [Ghost][ghost-wiki]. Players take turns adding letters to a fragment. The first player to spell a real word -- three letters or longer -- loses the round and earns a letter from G-H-O-S-T. Players who have lost five rounds will spell the word GHOST and are eliminated from the game. The last player remaining wins.
